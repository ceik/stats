# Curriculum

## Topics to cover

### Intro

This curriculum is based on the ASA guidelines for undergrad programs in
statistics, which can be found
[here](https://github.com/ceik/stats/tree/master/books).

The curriculum is split into four big parts. I will most likely neglect the
third part as I expect to pick up its topics along the way while working on
real world examples. Also the fourth part is obviously difficult to learn in
self-study mode. As a substitute for this I will pick up 1-2 pet projects after
I have covered all or most of the material in the first two parts.

I have ordered the remaining two parts, upon which I will focus, and their
topics according to how I am currently planning to work through them. The
subtopics are not ordered.
