# Introduction

Calculus is the mathematical study of change. Traditionally it has two major 
branches, __differential calculus__ and __integral calculus__. These two 
branches are related to each other by the __fundamental theorem of calculus__. 


# Differential Calculus

## Overview

Differential calculus is the study of the definition, properties, and 
applications of the derivative of a function. It is concerned with the study of 
the rates at which quantities change. Primary study objects are a functions 
__derivates__, which describe the rate of change of a function near an input 
value. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.

The derivative is a __linear operator__ __(research this term)__, which inputs a 
function and outputs another function. It is often denoted with a prime: The 
derivative of f is f' __(turn this into LaTeX)__. The derivate (f') represents 
the change with respect to the input of the original function (f). E.g. if f
takes time as an input and returns the position of an object at that time, f'
represents the change in position of the object with respect to time (velocity).
